          Online Privacy Protection Act notice. A Do Not Track (DNT) standard
          has not be adopted to this day, and therefore Superior Sales Services
          does not use DNT signals. Currently, various browsers (including
          Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT options that
          relies on a technology known as DNT header that sends a signal to
          websites visited by the browser user about the user’s DNT preference.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="margin-bottom-md">
          You can usually access your browser’s DNT options in your browser’s
          preferences. Superior Sales Services does not authorize the collection
          of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) for third party use through
          advertising technologies without separate your consent. We take
          privacy and security very seriously and strive to put our members
          first in all aspects of our business. With regard to DNT, we currently

        <p class="margin-bottom-md">
          If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your
